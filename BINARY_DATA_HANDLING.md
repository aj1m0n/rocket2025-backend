# Binary Data Handling Improvements

This document explains the changes made to fix the UnicodeDecodeError issues in the FastAPI backend application.

## Problem Overview

The application was encountering UnicodeDecodeError when handling binary data, specifically with the error message:
`UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 151: invalid start byte`

This occurred in the FastAPI JSON encoder when attempting to encode binary data that couldn't be properly decoded with UTF-8.

## Solution Implementation

We implemented several improvements across the codebase to ensure robust binary data handling:

### 1. Binary Utilities (`src/utils/binary.py`)

Created utility functions to safely handle binary data:

- `safe_b64decode`: Safely decodes Base64 strings with proper error handling
- `safe_b64encode`: Safely encodes binary data to Base64 with proper error handling
- `format_image_data_uri`: Formats binary data as a data URI (e.g., `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`)

### 2. Improved Exception Handling

Updated services to handle binary-related exceptions properly:

- Added specific UnicodeDecodeError handling
- Improved logging to help diagnose issues
- Added explicit type conversions to ensure proper JSON serialization

### 3. Service-Level Improvements

#### Emotion Recognition Service

- Enhanced `analyze` method to better handle binary data
- Added explicit float conversion for emotion scores
- Added logging for better diagnostics

#### Face Find Service

- Updated Base64 decoding/encoding to use our safe utilities
- Improved placeholder image generation
- Added detailed logging

### 4. Router-Level Improvements

Updated the face emotion router to:

- Use our safe binary utilities for Base64 conversion
- Handle different data URI formats properly
- Add better exception handling
- Ensure all JSON-returned values are properly serializable

### 5. Testing

Created comprehensive test scripts to verify that all API endpoints properly handle binary data:

- `test_face_emotion_apis.py`: Tests all face and emotion recognition endpoints

## How to Test

Run the test script to verify all API endpoints are working correctly:

```bash
python src/test/test_face_emotion_apis.py
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Error Reporting**: Consider implementing centralized error reporting to track any remaining binary data issues
2. **Input Validation**: Add more comprehensive validation for all binary data inputs
3. **API Documentation**: Update API documentation to clearly specify the expected data formats
